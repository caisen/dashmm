Installation Instruction for DASHMM
-----------------------------------

This document outlines briefly the instructions for building DASHMM and using
it in applications.


Prerequisites:

DASHMM depends on HPX-5 (version 2.1.0) available at https://hpx.crest.iu.edu/.
It is possible to build DASHMM on any system and environment on which HPX-5
can be built. DASHMM v. 0.5 is specialized to SMP operation, so building HPX-5
is very straightforward. The default values during configuration of HPX-5 are
likely sufficient, though one may perfer to control the installation location
by setting the prefix.

Once HPX-5 is installed, and the environment is set up (see
https://hpx.crest.iu.edu/users_guide#configuring_your_environment_to_use_hpx_5
for details) DASHMM is ready to be built.


---- Building DASHMM ----

It is assumed that the source code has been unpacked into some directory. This
guide shall use /path/to/dashmm/ to represent this location. The library can be
built by performing the following steps:

1) Change to the root directory of the unpacked code:

   'cd /path/to/dashmm/'

2) (OPTIONAL) DASHMM uses the GNU C++ compiler by default. If another compiler
   is desired, modify the first line of Makefile to your selection. For example,
   to use the Intel compiler, the first line should read:

   'CXX = icpc'

3) Run make:

   'make'

   This will build the library statically, producing
   /path/to/dashmm/libdashmm.a. This can then be linked into your application.

Please note that the build system uses pkg-config to set up correct compilation
and linking options for HPX-5. So it is important to add the correct path to
your PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable.


---- Demo Code ----

There is a basic demonstration of DASHMM provided in /path/to/dashmm/demo/basic/
that can be built after DASHMM has been built. For instruction, see the
README file in that directory.  It should be sufficient to change to that
directory and make the code. Then running './testdashmm' should perform a quick
test of the library.


---- Using DASHMM in your application ----

To use DASHMM, one need merely link against libdashmm.a. You will also need to
link against the HPX-5 library. An example of this is provided in
/path/to/dashmm/demo/basic/Makefile.
