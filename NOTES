Some notes about issues or future features

* In the future, we may want to have the ObjectHandle be something a little
more specific. Perhaps a dashmm::Array object. Of course, like everything else
it is backed by data in the GAS, but it would at least add some meaning to the
symbols in the code.

* We should get an ETA about the multiple run thing. If it looks too far out,
we should just implement in the stupid way that we would be forced to, but leave
in the other stuff as comments? Or something. At least in the dev branch. That
way when it finally does work, we can make that shit happen quickly.

* Perhaps make some nested namespaces that hide the internal implementation
objects so that the users do not accidentally clash with the internals. Though,
they should never define things in dashmm namespace anyway, so this might not
really be a problem.

* Go through the code and add markers that indicate that sections work only
in SMP mode. This will help us easily identify things to improve after the
first release.

* We will need to improve the error handling in this thing quite a bit.
Basically any way that the user-facing methods can go wrong should return
sensible error where possible instead of just being assertions that fail.
