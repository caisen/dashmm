This is the main repository for the DASHMM project.

To keep this repository clean, we shall adopt a similar workflow model as for
the development of HPX-5. The master branch will only be used for releases of
the code. All other commits should appear in the 'dev' branch. Individual
developers will work in their own branches and merge into 'dev.' Merging
incomplete or non-working code into 'dev' *will not happen.* Doing so will 
cause a change in the offenders permissions. Merging non-release code into
'master' *will not happen.*
