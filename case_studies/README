The case_studies folder is intended for small applications that implement a
certain part of the needed functionality of DASHMM. These will likely have code
that migrates into the actual code base. Each should be self-contained, and
should not link against code in other case studies. Copy and paste is
recommended for using existing code. You can think of these as micro-apps, used
by the DASHMM developers to explore the best methods to carry out the needed
operations.
