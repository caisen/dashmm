So there are some things left to take care of with this. In no particular
order:

 * Make the tree a template over the needed things

 * Add the remaining functionality from dashmm::Tree to the DualTree
 * Plug it into dashmm proper.
 * Debug, rinse, repeat


 * Change the expanded node construction to more standard single objects.
   In this way we can unify somewhat the abstraction. I am not sure that the
   alternate style is worth the effort. This is perhaps too much work to be
   worth it. I can leave a note to see if it impacts performance in some way.
   But not now. That is a test for later.
