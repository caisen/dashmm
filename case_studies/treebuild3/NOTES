So there are some things left to take care of with this. In no particular
order:

 * Make the tree able to handle same source and target records
 * Start adding the DAG stuff in - in particular, the application of the
   method ought to be pretty straightforward. This is just what we have
   adapted mildly to the new structure.

 * Go back through and privatize anything you can
 * See what you can do about the int vs. size_t thing here
 * Clean it all up.

 * Add the remaining functionality from dashmm::Tree to the DualTree
 * Plug it into dashmm proper.
 * Debug, rinse, repeat
