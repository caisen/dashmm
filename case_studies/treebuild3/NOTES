So there are some things left to take care of with this. In no particular
order:

 * Make the tree type less silly
   - This means make it more than a wrapper around the old globals
   - This means move the functionality into the DualTree class
 * Make the tree a template over the needed things
 * Introduce the sorting interfaces for the array
   - This includes the on rank sorting
      This should likely return an LCO for each rank into a spmd style action
      or back to the user when launched from user space.
   - This includes the across rank sorting
      This should also return an LCO for each rank, but also perhaps for each
      uniform node of the tree
 * Add the remaining functionality from dashmm::Tree to the DualTree
 * Plug it into dashmm proper.
 * Debug, rinse, repeat
