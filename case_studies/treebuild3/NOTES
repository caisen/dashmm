So there are some things left to take care of with this. In no particular
order:

DONE * Remove the extraneous sorting members - just do the std::partition style
DONE * Find the place that the actual rearrangement occurs, and remove that code
DONE * Make it so the sorted data ends up in the global address space
DONE * Have partition accept an array ref instead
DONE * This likely means that Node should have an array ref as well
DONE * Make the update to the sources and targets array - that is, change the
     meta data array values

 * Change the expanded node construction to more standard single objects.
   In this way we can unify somewhat the abstraction. I am not sure that the
   alternate style is worth the effort.

 * Need to build the top of the tree - perhaps the uniform grid nodes have
   a different type? To make it simpler on the differences between the various
   things.

 * Make the tree type less silly
   - This means make it more than a wrapper around the old globals
   - This means move the functionality into the DualTree class
 * Make the tree a template over the needed things
 * Introduce the sorting interfaces for the array
   - This includes the on rank sorting
      This should likely return an LCO for each rank into a spmd style action
      or back to the user when launched from user space.
   - This includes the across rank sorting
      This should also return an LCO for each rank, but also perhaps for each
      uniform node of the tree
 * Add the remaining functionality from dashmm::Tree to the DualTree
 * Plug it into dashmm proper.
 * Debug, rinse, repeat
