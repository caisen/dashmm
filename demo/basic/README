-----------------------
testdashmm demo program
-----------------------

This demo contains a simple utility to demonstrate the basic use of
DASHMM for both BH and FMM cases. The utility produces a random selection
of sources and targets in three different distributions (selectable separately
for sources and targets).


-----------------
Building the Demo
------------------

To build the demo follow these steps:

1) Build the DASHMM library.

2) In this folder, run 'make'.


--------------
Using the demo
--------------

To run the demo, type './testdashmm'. This will run the utility with a set
of default arguments. The behavior of the demo can be controlled by a set of
command line arguments.

Options available: [possible/values] (default value)
  --method=[fmm/fmm97/b        method to use (fmm97)
  --nsources=num               number of source points to generate (10000)
  --sourcedata=[cube/sphere/plummer]
                               source distribution type (cube)
  --ntargets=num               number of target points to generate (10000)
  --targetdata=[cube/sphere/plummer]
                               target distribution type (cube)
  --threshold=num              source and target tree partition refinement
                                 limit (40)
  --accuracy=num               number of digits of accuracy for fmm (3)
  --verify=[yes/no]            perform an accuracy test comparing to direct
                                 summation (yes)
  --kernel=[laplace/yukawa/helmholtz]
                               particle interaction type (laplace)

After running, the code will output some summary information.

There is one HPX-5 command line argument that may be of use. Specifying
--hpx-threads=num on the command line will control how many scheduler threads
HPX-5 is using. If this is not specified, then HPX-5 will use one thread per
available core on the system. In principle, the number of scheduler threads
is limited only by the available system resources. In practice, you will not
improve performance using more HPX-5 threads than there are cores on your
system.
