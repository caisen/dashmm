// This will contain that stuff that is added to the basic interface that
// will allow for more advanced operation. Basically, what does one need
// know to implement Expansions and Methods? But will this also be a
// superset of the basic guide? Or should we have two parts in one guide?

// dag.h
// Pretty much all of this stuff

// policy stuff - what is the default, and which are available, hot to define
// a new policy

// expansion concept

// method concept

// DomainGeometry
// Index

// Node types (both s and T)

// ViewSet
