# DASHMM

The Dynamic Adaptive System for Hierarchical Multipole Methods (DASHMM) is a 
flexible, extensible library implementing multipole methods using a dynamic 
and adaptive computational approach. DASHMM is designed to easily allow users 
to create tools usable in production-level end science that display 
significantly improved strong scaling and efficiency for these applications.

More details about the project can be found under Details. DASHMM can be 
applied to a number of application domains. To start learning how to use 
DASHMM, please visit User Guides and Tutorials. To download the latest version 
of DASHMM, please visit Get DASHMM, or for prior versions please visit 
Resources. To learn more about the DASHMM team, visit About DASHMM Team.
