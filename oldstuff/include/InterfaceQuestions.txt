For the basic interface, there are a number of things that the user 
might need to query about the methods. Things like
    - number of charges per point (typically this is 1, but advanced user
      kernels might use more)
    - available accuracies
    - 


We will need to make a Macro that wraps up the HPX-5 macro for defining a 
function. All of the kernel functions will have to be done this way. Similarly
for the MAC functions as well.
