# DASHMM Team

DASHMM was created at the 
[Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies](http://crest.iu.edu/) at
Indiana University by Jackson DeBuhr and Bo Zhang. The project has
also benefited from the advice of Luke D'Alessandro and Thomas Sterling.

Along the way, a number of students have contributed to the project. They are:
*   Silvio Mayolo; Undergraduate from Tennessee Technological University; REU Summer 2017
*   Drake Niedzielski; Undergraduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; REU Summer 2017
