So the next step is to work out how to make this stuff useful.

 * Do I want to have a means to replace things with segments?
 * I do want to be able to overlay a tree on the event data, so do we 
   finalize in some way the objects. That makes further additions to the
   data impossible, and will then build the tree on top of the existing 
   data.
